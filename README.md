# topgun-ursina-flight-simulator
High graphic definition 3D tactical gameplay mechanics incorporating separate functions for yaw, roll, and pitch; incorporates high-definition aircraft where the goal is to achieve a stealth flight between 3D high-graphic mesh-type mountains and drop bombs on an enemy bunk with successful impact(inspired by the movie: Top Gun Maverick).

## About:

The Top Gun U.F.S.(Ursina Flight Simulator), is designed to be the first flight simulator in Ursina that incorporates tactical gravity feedback with manual yaw, pitch, and roll controls. The game is developed to be played mainly on a PC, but can additionally can be downloaded and played an a Play Station/Xbox(I prefer this option). However, the game will be sold to private gaming companies/coding institutions   , rather than being sold to the public.

Pictures of Simulator in 2024 preceding Christmas Eve(This was at the time when I was using a temporary ursina plane model and temporary textured runway, rather than a privately built 3D fighter aircraft model in Blender and a privately built 3D model air base-this will be completed in 2025):
